			<p>Technology can be a powerful tool for transforming learning. It can help affirm and advance relationships between educators and students, reinvent our approaches to learning and collaboration, shrink long-standing equity and accessibility gaps, and adapt learning experiences to meet the needs of all learners.

Furthermore, education stakeholders should commit to working together to use technology to improve American education. These stakeholders include leaders; teachers, faculty, and other educators; researchers; policymakers; funders; technology developers; community members and organizations; and learners and their families.

			<h2>Negative aspects of Technology</h2>
			<p>Advancements in technology today are much like the advancements in manufacturing during the industrial revolution in the 1800’s. Technology drives our economy and has become crucial to communication world wide. At the same time technology has completely changed how we communicate. Americans today spend more time texting, calling and messaging on Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, and Facetime than they spend in face to face conversation. This change took place rapidly over the last few decades and has had an overwhelmingly negative effect on the quantity and quality of communication.()www.cram.com/essay/Negative-Effects-Of-Technology/F39GWU5KGY3Q</p><br><br>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Progress in many of thes basic computing and information technologies has been rapid in recent years, and the committee does not expect the pace of change to slow down in the foreseeable future. While some technologies are reaching maturity now, many important technologies have enormous future potential. As more of the world’s information is digitized and more people and things are networked, the economics of the digital, networked economy will become ever more important. This includes the ability to make copies of goods and services at almost zero cost and deliver them anywhere on the planet almost instantaneously. Furthermore, digitization of products, services, processes, and interactions makes it possible to measure and manage work with far more precision. Data-driven decision making and machine learning provide vast opportunities for improving productivity, efficiency, accuracy, and innovation.(www.nap.edu/read/24649/chapter/9)</p>
